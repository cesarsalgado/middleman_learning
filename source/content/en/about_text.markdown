Hi! My name is Cesar Salgado Vieira de Souza. I graduated in 2012 from University of Sao Paulo with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.

In 2012 I worked as a Software Engineer for 8 months programming in Java. Then I decided to take a year off to study many things which I would like to know more before moving on.

Next year I plan to start a master's degree program in Machine Learning.
